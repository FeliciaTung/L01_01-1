# TEAM cRAFTers
# CSCC01 2017 Fall team project
This project is to build an encouraging assignment system for statistic students. 


## Deliverables 

This [file](https://github.com/CSCC01F17/L01_01/blob/master/project_documentation/ProjectTeamAgreement.pdf) is an introduction to cRAFTers (our team for this project).

We have identified the key personas and developed user stories from the personas, which can be found [here](https://github.com/CSCC01F17/L01_01/blob/master/product_backlog/userpersonas+stories_v0.pdf).

Our first sprint (Sprint 0) report can be found [here](https://github.com/CSCC01F17/L01_01/blob/master/product_backlog/product_backlog_sprint0.pdf).
