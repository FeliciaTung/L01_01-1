This project is to build an encouraging assignment system for statistic students. 


## Deliverables 

This [file](https://github.com/CSCC01F17/L01_01/blob/master/project_documentation/ProjectTeamAgreement.pdf) is an introduction to cRAFTers (our team for this project).

We have identified the key personas and developed user stories from the personas, which can be found [here](https://github.com/CSCC01F17/L01_01/blob/master/product_backlog/userpersonas+stories_v0.12.pdf) (this is the latest edition of our product backog as of 2017-10-15).
